# Changelog

All notable changes to Bot-Harness are recorded here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Rules for agents

- **Every session that changes a file adds a line here.** No exceptions, including
  documentation-only sessions.
- Write what changed *for the user of the system*, not what you typed. "Agent can now read
  files outside the workspace after approval" beats "added path check to FileTool.swift".
- Link the ADR when a change implements a decision: `(see docs/decisions/0007-....md)`.
- Group under `Added` / `Changed` / `Deprecated` / `Removed` / `Fixed` / `Security`.
- `Security` is not optional. Any change to the permission model, credential handling,
  sandboxing, or what the agent is allowed to touch goes under `Security` even if it is
  also an `Added`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Repository scaffold: `app/` (SwiftUI cockpit), `core/` (agent runtime), `docs/`,
  `.claude/` (project-specific agent configuration), `evals/`, `var/` (traces + artifacts).
- Architecture decision record system under `docs/decisions/` with a mandatory
  falsifier field on every record.
- Append-only decision trace: every tool call made by any agent working in this repo is
  captured to `var/traces/agent-activity.jsonl` via a Claude Code hook.
